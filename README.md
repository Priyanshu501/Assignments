# Data Science: Practice Repository

Welcome to the repository for my Data Science Assignments! This repository contains all the assignments I have completed as part of my data science coursework. Each assignment is organized into its own folder, containing the relevant files, code, and documentation.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment, with each assignment in its own directory. The structure is as follows:

<pre>
.
├── Assignment1/
│   ├── problem_statement.docx or .txt
│   ├── assignment1.ipynb
│   ├── data.csv or .xlsx
├── Assignment2/
│   ├── problem_statement.docx or .txt
│   ├── assignment2.ipynb
│   ├── data.csv or .xlsx
├── Assignment3/
│   ├── problem_statement.docx or .txt
│   ├── assignment2.ipynb
│   ├── data.csv or .xlsx
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
</pre>

## Assignments

Each assignment folder contains the following:

* `problem_statement.docx`: A brief description of the assignment, the tasks involved, and any specific instructions or notes.

* `assignmentX.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook file with the code and explanations for the assignment tasks.

* `data.csv`: Dataset for the assignment

## Problem Statement Structure

* Tasks:

    1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

        * Loading and exploring the dataset.
        * Handling missing values.
        * Data normalization and transformation.

    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        * Performing descriptive statistics.
        * Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
        * Identifying patterns and outliers.
    
    3. Machine Learning Model Development

        * Splitting data into training and test sets.
        * Training and Evaluating different machine learning models.
        * Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
